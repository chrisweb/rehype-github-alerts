# rehype-github-alerts

rehype plugin to create alerts (admonitions/callouts), mimicking the way alerts get rendered on github.com, currently three types of alerts are supported:

> [!NOTE]  
> I'm a note :wave:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I'm important

> [!WARNING]  
> I'm a warning

this is a zero configuration package as all [options](#options) have defaults, but you can use them if you wish to modify default behavior, like for example by default 3 alerts are defined with a default icon and color, use `options.alerts` to replace them with your own setup

## installation

```shell
npm i rehype-github-alerts --save-exact
```

### optional packages

if you use this package, there are other packages you might want to install too, for examle:

- [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm), adds support for [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (autolink literals, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists)
- [remark-breaks](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-breaks), turns soft line endings (enters) into hard breaks (`<br>`s). GitHub does this in a few places (comments, issues, PRs, and releases)

## examples

I created [an issue on github](https://github.com/chrisweb/rehype-github-alerts/issues/1) to check how github is rendering alerts, or look at [another test page](https://github.com/dipree/markdown-highlight-test) for github alerts by the author of the github implementation himself

### rehype example

check out the [readme of the rehype example](./examples/simple-rehype-example/README.md) for more details about this example, all the source code is located in `examples/simple-rehype-example/`

## options

`options` (optional)

all options have default values which for most use cases should be enough, meaning there is zero configuration to do, unless you want to customize something

- `alerts` (`IAlert[]`) 
- `supportLegacy` (`boolean`, default: true)
- `build` (`DefaultBuildType`)

### types

If you use typescript and intend to edit the options, for example to create custom alerts, then you may want to import the types used by this library:

```ts
import { rehypeGithubAlerts, IOptions } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const myOptions: IOptions = {
    alerts: [
        {
            keyword: 'MY_ALERT',
            icon: '<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"/></svg>',
            color: 'rgb(255, 255, 255)',
            title: 'My Alert',
        },
    ],
}
```

## icons

the 3 icons used in this package are from [Codicons repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons) and licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons/blob/main/LICENSE)
